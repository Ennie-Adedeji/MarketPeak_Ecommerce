This README.md file documents  the steps taken to develop an e-commerce website, utilizing Git for version control, developing the platform in a linux environment , and deploying it on an AWS EC2 instance.
The initial step in this project involved comprehending the project's objectives, anticipated outcomes, and outlining the high-level steps needed to achieve them.
## Task 1.1 Initialise git repository
To achieve this task, firstly, set up Git on your local machine; you can download and install it from the official Git website. Alternatively, you can use a package manager on your operating system to install Git. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Git using the following command: sudo apt install git.
This command installs Git on your local machine, next step is to create a directory where you want to initialize the Git repository. You can use the 'mkdir' command to create a new directory; for example "mkdir project-directory".
Upon creating the directory, navigate into it using the "cd" command. 
Once you're in the desired directory, run the "git init" command to create a new Git repository. This command generates a .git directory in the current location, containing all the essential files for version control.
